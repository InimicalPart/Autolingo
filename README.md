<h1 align="center">Autolingo</h1>

An automated system doing lessons on Duolingo and gaining XP. Autolingo ~~does~~ will do this by using a browser extension and a proxy server.

The browser extension won't be mandatory but it is recommended to make stuff go faster.

Autolingo will monitor the network traffic between you and Duolingo's servers, and grab lesson details and answers from the responses Duolingo's server make.
Without the browser extension, Autolingo will only print out the correct answers in the terminal, but with the browser extension, Autolingo will also complete the lessons for you automatically, allowing you to skyrocket to #1 on the leaderboard.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for this project, feel free to create an issue or pull request!

Also if anyone from my league on Duolingo or someone on the staff team sees this, I want to clarify that I have not and am not planning to use this on my personal Duolingo account. I made a secondary account with the intention of testing this out. That account also can't get into leaderboards at this moment, so no harm no foul.

Duolingo staff, if you have problems with this repository, please contact me at <a href="me@inimicalpart.com">me@inimicalpart.com</a> before sending me a cease and desist letter.
